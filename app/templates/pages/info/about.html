        Our Mission: Organize Your Thoughts into Actions
    </h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        Welcome to Projectify, a modern productivity app built on a simple
        premise: your life isn't one-dimensional, so your tools shouldn't be
        either.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        We all juggle different roles. You might be a student, an athlete, a
        creative, and a meticulous planner all at the same time. Traditional
        productivity apps force all of these contexts into a single, messy list.
        Projectify is designed to fix that.

        What Makes Projectify Different? The "Identities" System
    </h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        The core of Projectify is the **Identity**. An identity is a "hat" you
        wear in life. Instead of one cluttered dashboard, you create a distinct
        space for each of your roles:

    <ul class="about-list">
        <li class="about-list-item">
            <span class="about-list-item-header">The Learner:</span>
            <span class="about-list-item-text">
                For tracking educational goals and new skills.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li class="about-list-item">
            <span class="about-list-item-header">The Builder:</span>
            <span class="about-list-item-text">
                For managing your side projects and tasks.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li class="about-list-item">
            <span class="about-list-item-header">The Health Nut:</span>
            <span class="about-list-item-text">
                For logging workouts and wellness goals.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li class="about-list-item">
            <span class="about-list-item-header">The Organizer:</span>
            <span class="about-list-item-text">
                For handling schedules, budgets, and daily life.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="about-text">
        By switching your active identity, you change your entire context. You
        only see the projects, tasks, and thoughts relevant to that role,
        allowing you to focus completely on what matters most in the moment.

    <h3 class="about-header">About the Developer</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        Hi, I'm Alan O'Connor, the developer behind Projectify. I built this
        application as a way to explore the challenges of building a modern,
        full-stack web application from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        This project was a deep dive into building a robust, scalable backend
        architecture using Flask, combined with a responsive, intuitive, and
        beautiful frontend. My focus was on writing clean, reusable code (like
        the Manager pattern) and ensuring all database operations are atomic and
        secure.
